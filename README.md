 📖Developing a Player Management System in C: Simplifying Organization 📖

For my recent project, I designed a Player Management System in C to make managing player data efficient and straightforward. This system is packed with features that allow users to keep player information well-organized, searchable, and up-to-date.

🏷 Key Features Include:
♦ Add & Remove Player: Easily add new player with key details or remove player when needed, keeping data organized.
♦ Quick Search Options: Search player by Jersey Number ,Player Name and retrieve all players by Jersey Number enabling users to quickly access player detail.
♦ Update & Display Players: Users can update players Run ,Wickets ,Matches and view sorted Player information based on maximum/minimum Runs and Wickets.
♦ Highlight Top Picks: The system displays the top 3 Player by Run and Wickets, helping users find standout options.

This project provided valuable insights into data management and the practical applications of C programming. Excited to continue developing solutions that simplify information management and organization!
